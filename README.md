# Elementally
The finite element solver ELementally was merely written to get a better grasp
of Python, it is not meant to solve any problems not already handled far more
throroughly elsewhere.

## Status
As of 13 August 2014, solely the 1D Poisson equation has been fully realized.

## Software packages
Elementally leans heavily on the following packages:
* [Meshpy](mathema.tician.de/software/meshpy "MeshPy")
* [Scipy](www.scipy.org)
* [Numpy](www.numpy.org)

## Guidelines
Since this software is written as a means to learning Python, emphasis is laid
on restraining all code to follow the [PEP 8](legacy.python.org/dev/peps/
pep-0008 "Style Guide for Python Code")

## Theory
This brief theory section constitutes mainly of [Numerical Models for
Differential Problems](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Numerical-Models-Differential-
Problems-MS-ebook/dp/B00JY5G3T4/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&qid=1407928272&sr=8-2&
keywords=quarteroni "Amazon.co.uk"). Page references are made where applicable.
