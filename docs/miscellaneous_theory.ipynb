      "\n",
      "*The following is from [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weak_formulatio) and is basically written down for Tarjei to get a better grasp of the concepts.*\n",
      "\n",
      "**Weak formulations** are an important tool for the analysis of mathematical equations that permit the transfer of concepts of linear algebra to solve problmes in other fields such as partial differential equations. In a weak formulation, an equation is no longer required to hold absolutely (and this is not even well defined) and has instead weak solutions only with respect to certain \"test vectors\" or \"test functions\". This is equivalent to formulating the problem to require a solution in the sense of a distribution.\n",

      "where $A: V \\mapsto V'$ and $f \\in V'$, with $V'$ being the dual of $V$.\n",
      "Calculus of variations tells us that this is equivalent to finding $u \\in V$ such that for all $v \\in V$ the following holds:\n",
      "$$ [Au](v) = f(v)$$.\n",
      "Here, we call $v$\u00a0a test vector or test function.\n",

      "> \"discontinuous finite element method\" since the original equation is multiplied by the characteristic funcion of each grid cell which is defined by $1_K (x) = 1$, if $x \\in K$, $1_K (x) = 0$, if $x \\notin K$, and the discrete unkown may be considered as a linear combination of shape functions.\n",

      "On a similat note, we may consider the FVM a \"zero-th order finite element method\"."
